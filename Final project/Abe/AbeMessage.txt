Hello Professor. This is Jin Young You. First of all, thank you so much for teaching and guide me this project. I know that I asked a lot of questions because I don't know many things, yet you helped me so much. I hope I can ask some questions about anything later on even tho I am not going to be your student anymore. I hope I can keep a touch with you. Once again thank you so much. Have a wonderful and safe break, Professor!
